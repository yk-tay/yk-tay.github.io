## Times when I Miss OSX

- When I want to use a good Code editor like Expresso or Coda. Notepad++ is solid, but I miss auto-completion.
- When I want to temporarily indicate/label files in the filesystem without moving their location or changing their names. OSX has colour flags. Windows has nothing.
- When I want to minimize a window to the dock, putting it out of my workspace while keeping its state. I think there are utilities for this, but I haven't come across a good one yet.
- When I want to run UNIX commands
