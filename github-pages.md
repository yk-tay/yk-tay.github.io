# Github pages

So I want to create a site that's a compilation of my notes on things 

I want to migrate over stuff that I currently have from:
- simplenote
- assorted text files
- markdown files

## Why do this?
Inspired by http://stnly.com/


## Steps
1. Create a github repo for the site
Github is strangely scarce on documentation on this, but basially I had to create a new repo that uses my username, in a very specific format:
`username/username.github.io`
