# Mornings
##### Morning Optimization/Work Day Hacking

Something that has fascinated me for a while is the idea of becoming an early riser + using a relatively predictable morning schedule and triggers to habitually do things to make progress on goals.

Historically, I've had good mornings, and a lot of bad mornings.


## Epic People Wake Early

- Margaret Thatcher - 5am
- Robert Iger, CEO of Disney - 4.30am

## Helps In Habit Forming

### Exercise
Most people who work out early work out in the morning
Boost of energy for the rest of the day
Won't feel 'too tired for a workout' after a day at work

### Map/Plan Out Day
Easier reflection, quiet
Good for problem solving

### Eat a healthy breakfast

### Visualisation

### Front-load/Top-heavy your day
Do the least desirable task on your list first, get the unpleasantness of it out
Do the hard stuff when you are well rested and have energy
Your day gets progressively easier, not harder

## Things to do at the start of every work day
1. Arrive on time 
	- Leave a good impression
	- Have a good mindset for the day
	- Feeling of accomplishment
2. Take a deep breath 
	- Literally
	- Focus on the here and now
	- Take a moment to pause and centre yourself
	- Set the tone for the day
	- Dont be rushed and frantic
3. Eat a proper breakfast
4. Start each day with a clean slate
	- This relates to treating a workplace like a restaurant kitchen and the mind like water concept
